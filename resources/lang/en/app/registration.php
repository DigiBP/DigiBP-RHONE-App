Diagnosis can be confirmed by blood glucose monitoring (amount of sugar in your blood) and/or the amount of sugar in your red blood cells (Hemoglobin), which is often labelled as HbA1c.  At a later stage, we will ask you to provide record of these values.  If you donâ€™t remember these values or measured longer than 3 months ago, it is advisable to have them done again.',
